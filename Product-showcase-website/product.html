            <p class="para">We typically ship the sarees within 3 business days.
           We provide shipping through India post and DTDC based on your preference. The number of days taken to deliver will vary with each shipping service, city and town shipping regulations etc.
          A preorder saree will take typically around 20-25 days to dispatch as these would be woven on conformation of the order. We will notify you if there is any changes in the ETA via Instagram,email,whatsapp.
           International shipping charges would generally cost about 2200/kg and 1500 for additional individual saree added.
             This typically reaches within 4-5 business working days based on your current country’s regulations.</p>

            <h2 align="center" class="logop">RETURN POLICY</h2>
            <p class="para">Our sarees and other clothing items are either handloom made/handwoven/hand painted or hand dyed.
            As these involve various activities by hand, there will be slight irregularities, inconsistencies and print errors.
            These show the authenticity of the make and will not be considered as damage.
            Furthermore, we at Navarasam, run each order through multiple rounds of quality check for any damages.
            Please feel free to go through our customer reviews on our instagram handle and reach out to us to have a conversation. 
           We take utmost care and effort to make sure the product match its real colour. However, there will be 5-10% colour change as it depends on individual phone/laptop/browser pixel quality, image resolution, brightness etc.
           Return/exchange will not be entertained on colour variation issues due to the above mentioned reason.
           If the product has been received damaged, we would require a parcel opening video to be sent on our WhatsApp number with the order number, name and city within 2 days of receiving the order.</p>
