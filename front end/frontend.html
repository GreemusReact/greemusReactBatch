        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages, is essential for front-end development because it gives developers a way to define the content and structure of a website or application. HTML tags define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other elements that make up a web page. </p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and layout of a document written in HTML. CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of a website or application. It allows developers to separate the content and structure defined in HTML from the visual presentation of the site, making it easier to maintain and update the appearance of a website. </p>

        <h2>React</h2>
        <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). Meta developed it to allow developers to create modular UI components and manage the state of their applications more efficiently. The benefits of using React include its reusable modular architecture, which makes it easy to build and maintain large and complex applications, and its efficient rendering engine, which allows for smooth and fast updates to the user interface.
