                      <summary><h2>Procedure:</h2>Take the finely chopped or grated veggies 
                        in a bowl.  you will need ½ cup finely chopped red cabbage, ½ cup grated carrot,
                        ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper), ¼ cup finely chopped french beans
                        and ¼ cup finely chopped spring onions.You can also add regular green cabbage instead 
                        of red or purple cabbage.Then add the dry ingredients – 2 tablespoons corn starch,
                        2 tablespoons all purpose flour (maida), ½ teaspoon black pepper and ½ teaspoon salt or
                        add as required.Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so 
                        that the veggies leave the water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like 
                        that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture
                        in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices.
                        Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls
                         does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for 
                         frying these veggie balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can 
                         add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour (maida). In a small bowl take the following
                          three sauces – ½ tablespoon soy sauce (or 1.5 teaspoons soy sauce), 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup,
                           2 to 3 teaspoons of red chilli sauce. The red chilli sauce is spicy and not sweet.In another small
                            bowl take 1 tablespoon cornflour (corn starch) and 2 tablespoons water. Mix very well and keep aside.
                            Heat 1 to 1.5 tablespoons oil in a pan or wok. Add 4 tablespoons chopped spring onions (scallions), 1 tablespoon
                             finely chopped ginger, 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic, 2 green chilies (finely chopped) and ¼ cup finely chopped
                          capsicum (green bell pepper).Adding capsicum is optional. You can use toasted sesame oil or sunflower oil or any neutral tasting oil.
                          . Serve Veg Manchurian Gravy hot garnished with some spring onion greens (scallion greens). It goes well with veg fried rice or schezwan
                           fried rice or plain steamed rice or noodles and even bread or roti.

               <summary><h2>Procedure:</h2>First rinse and then soak 1 heaped cup basmati rice in 
                enough water for 30 mins. You could make use of any non-sticky variety of rice to
                 make this biryani. After 20 to 30 minutes drain all the water from the rice and 
                 set the rice grains aside. When the rice is soaking, prep the rest of the 
                 ingredients like chopping veggies, mushrooms, getting your spices and herbs ready etc.
                 Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a deep pan or pot. Make sure that the bottom of the pan is
                 thick, otherwise the rice can get browned or burn while cooking. When the oil becomes hot,
                 lower the heat. Add all the whole spices – ½ teaspoon fennel seeds, ½ teaspoon cumin seeds,
                 2 to 3 cloves, 1 tej patta (Indian bay leaf), 1 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 green cardamoms, 1
                 small star anise and 2 to 3 thin strands of mace.. Next add 2 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste,
                1 teaspoon chopped green chilies, 2 tablespoons of chopped mint, 2 tablespoon chopped 
                coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed finely chopped tomatoes and 8 to 10 curry leaves.
                Mix again very well so that the masala or dry spice powders get mixed evenly with the rest 
                of the mixture. Sauté for a minute. Add chopped or sliced button mushrooms.Add the soaked rice grains.
                Cover the pan with a lid. On a low heat cook the biryani until the rice grains are tender, fluffy with 
                all the water absorbed. If the rice grains are under cooked and the water has evaporated, add about ¼
                 to ½ cup hot water or more as needed.
                 Serve mushroom biryani hot or warm.

                    chopping walnuts coarsely. Now, whisk shortening and butter together
                    in a bowl until fluffy. Next, add sugar in this mix and whisk it well 
                    until dissolved. Now, one by one, crack open the eggs in the mix and whisk
                    continuously. Next, mix in 1 cup flour along with vanilla essence and milk.
                    Mix it well only in one direction to avoid any lumps. Now, mix in the remaining
                    flour with baking powder and salt. Whisk this batter until a smooth consistency 
                    is attained. Add the chopped walnuts in it and give it a final stir.
                    Pour in a baking dish & bake for 20 minutes
                    Next, apply some oil to a baking dish and dust with some flour.

            <summary><h2>Procedure:</h2> First, peel the oranges. Do remove the pith and the white layers
             from the orange segments. You can put them in a bowl and chill them in the fridge for
              20 to 30 minutes before blending, if you like your it cold. Once ready, add the orange
             segments in a mixie jar or blender jar. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. This is optional and 
             you can skip if you want. However, I really like how the tartness of the lemon balances the sweetness of the oranges.
             It also will help keep the juice tasting fresher for a bit longer if you plan to chill in the fridge before drinking.
             Run the mixer or blender on low to medium speed for several seconds, until the mixture becomes pulpy and the oranges are crushed.
             Avoid blending too much though, as we just need to crush the segments and do not want to pulverize the seeds.
              You can also use the pulse option of the mixer or blender. Set a strainer over a bowl, and pour in the juice.
               You can use a juice strainer or a mesh strainer. Use a spoon to press and move the pulp around to help strain
                the juice. Continue to do this until as much of the juice as possible has been strained into the bowl.
                 You should only have the stringy pulp remaining after all the juice is strained. You will have to discard 
                 the pulp as it will be bitter or you can add it to your compost.Pour immediately into two tall glasses and serve orange juice.
