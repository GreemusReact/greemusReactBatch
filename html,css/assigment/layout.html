What is data mining?
Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets.

Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge. However, despite the fact that that technology continuously evolves to handle data at a large scale, leaders still face challenges with scalability and automation.

Data mining has improved organizational decision-making through insightful data analyses. The data mining techniques that underpin these analyses can be divided into two main purposes; they can either describe the target dataset or they can predict outcomes through the use of machine learning algorithms. These methods are used to organize and filter data, surfacing the most interesting information, from fraud detection to user behaviors, bottlenecks and even security breaches.

When combined with data analytics and visualization tools, like Apache Spark, delving into the world of data mining has never been easier and extracting relevant insights has never been faster. Advances within artificial intelligence only continue to expedite adoption across industries.

Data mining process
The data mining process involves a number of steps from data collection to visualization to extract valuable information from large data sets. As mentioned above, data mining techniques are used to generate descriptions and predictions about a target data set. Data scientists describe data through their observations of patterns, associations and correlations. They also classify and cluster data through classification and regression methods, and identify outliers for use cases, like spam detection.

Data mining usually consists of four main steps: setting objectives, data gathering and preparation, applying data mining algorithms and evaluating results.

1. Set the business objectives: This can be the hardest part of the data mining process, and many organizations spend too little time on this important step. Data scientists and business stakeholders need to work together to define the business problem, which helps inform the data questions and parameters for a given project. Analysts may also need to do additional research to understand the business context appropriately.

2. Data preparation: Once the scope of the problem is defined, it is easier for data scientists to identify which set of data will help answer the pertinent questions to the business. Once they collect the relevant data, it will be cleaned, removing any noise, such as duplicates, missing values and outliers. Depending on the dataset, an additional step may be taken to reduce the number of dimensions as too many features can slow down any subsequent computation. Data scientists will look to retain the most important predictors to ensure optimal accuracy within any models.

3. Model building and pattern mining: Depending on the type of analysis, data scientists may investigate any interesting data relationships, such as sequential patterns, association rules or correlations. While high-frequency patterns have broader applications, sometimes the deviations in the data can be more interesting, highlighting areas of potential fraud.

Deep learning algorithms may also be applied to classify or cluster a data set depending on the available data. If the input data is labelled (i.e. supervised learning), a classification model may be used to categorize data, or alternatively, a regression may be applied to predict the likelihood of a particular assignment. If the dataset isnâ€™t labelled (i.e. unsupervised learning), the individual data points in the training set are compared with one another to discover underlying similarities, clustering them based on those characteristics.

4. Evaluation of results and implementation of knowledge: Once the data is aggregated, the results need to be evaluated and interpreted. When finalizing results, they should be valid, novel, useful and understandable. When this criteria is met, organizations can use this knowledge to implement new strategies, achieving their intended objectives.
