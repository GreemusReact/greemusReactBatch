    <h1>HTML</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Developers use the hypertext markup language (HTML) to create web pages and dynamic documents. 
            This is a basic programming language that front-end developers can learn by taking courses, participating in workshops, reading HTML tutorials, reading books, or watching a series of videos. 
            Developers have several forums, online communities, and groups on social media platforms where they can share their knowledge, concerns, and experiences. 
            To code an HTML document, you require an editor program to write the HTML code, execute it in test mode, and visualize a preview.</p>
    
    <h1>CSS</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The cascading style sheets (CSS) is a programming language used to style web pages, which means to add or modify the layout of a web page. 
            Developers can use CSS to change the colour, fonts, margins, and borders of text on a web page. 
            This allows them to create flexible websites that users can visualize on different devices, such as laptops, mobiles, tablets, monitors, or even printers. 
            You can use CSS with HTML to create a website that looks the same on any device, as both languages can function independently of one another.</p>
        
    <h1>JavaScript</h1>

        <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">about</a>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language designed to create websites and web-based apps. 
            Developers can use it to create dynamic content, animated graphics, user interfaces, games, presentations, and mobile apps. 
            As JavaScript is a simple and versatile language, platforms such as web browsers, web servers, and operating systems can support and execute it. 
            Programmers can also embed JavaScript in hardware controls, such as webcams and microphones, which means they can use it to manipulate physical devices.</p>
        
    <h1>ReactJs</h1>

        <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">about</a>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>ReactJs is an open-source library based on JavaScript and HTML to build user interfaces (UIs) for applications. 
            This programming language also provides JavaScript built-in features that enhance the way a developer can design a website's UI. 
            Developers can use ReactJs to create social media applications, e-commerce apps, blogs, instant messaging computer programs, tracker apps, such as workout training apps, music players, or to-do list apps.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Typescript is a programming language that comprises a set of tools for application development. 
            It enhances editor apps by adding additional syntax to JavaScript and making it easier to debug the code. 
            This is possible because developers can add more strings to their code, detailing and identifying all the elements and objects they're using in the code. 
            This allows them to fix errors quickly, as they can identify the exact code line and element that's causing the issue.</p>
